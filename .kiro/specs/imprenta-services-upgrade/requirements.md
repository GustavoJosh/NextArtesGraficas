# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on upgrading the existing imprenta (printing services) section to provide clients with a clearer, more informative view of the business's regular printing services. The upgrade will enhance the current service display by adding detailed service information, delivery timelines, and real examples of finished work. The services include traditional printing (flyers, banners, stickers) and laser services (engraving and cutting).

2. WHEN a user views a service category THEN the system SHALL show detailed descriptions of what each service includes
3. WHEN a user browses services THEN the system SHALL distinguish between traditional printing services (flyers, banners, stickers) and laser services (engraving, cutting)

### Requirement 2

3. WHEN a service has rush options available THEN the system SHALL indicate expedited delivery options and timeframes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a potential client, I want to see real examples of finished printing work, so that I can assess the quality and style before making a decision.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a printing service THEN the system SHALL display a gallery of real finished examples
2. WHEN examples are shown THEN the system SHALL include diverse samples representing different styles, materials, and applications
3. WHEN a user clicks on an example THEN the system SHALL provide a larger view with additional details about the project

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a client, I want to easily filter and find specific printing services, so that I can quickly locate what I need without browsing through irrelevant options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the imprenta section THEN the system SHALL provide filtering options by service type
2. WHEN a user applies a filter THEN the system SHALL show only relevant services and hide others
