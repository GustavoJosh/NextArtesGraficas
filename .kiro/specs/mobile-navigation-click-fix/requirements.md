# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical user experience issue where mobile navigation interactions (hamburger menu and breadcrumb navigation) are being intercepted by the circular gallery component's global event listeners. When users attempt to navigate on mobile devices, clicking on navigation elements triggers the gallery's image modal instead of performing the intended navigation, severely disrupting the user flow and making the site unusable on mobile devices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to be able to open and use the hamburger navigation menu without triggering gallery image modals, so that I can navigate between different sections of the website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user taps the hamburger menu button on mobile THEN the system SHALL open the navigation menu without triggering any gallery interactions
2. WHEN a user taps on navigation items within the mobile menu THEN the system SHALL navigate to the selected page without opening image modals
3. WHEN the mobile navigation menu is open THEN the system SHALL prevent gallery click events from interfering with menu interactions
4. WHEN a user taps the close (X) button in the mobile menu THEN the system SHALL close the menu without triggering gallery events

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to interact with breadcrumb navigation without accidentally opening gallery images, so that I can understand my current location and navigate efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user taps on breadcrumb navigation links THEN the system SHALL navigate to the corresponding page without opening image modals
2. WHEN a user taps on the home icon in breadcrumbs THEN the system SHALL navigate to the homepage without triggering gallery interactions
3. WHEN breadcrumb elements are visible THEN the system SHALL ensure they have higher event priority than gallery click handlers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the circular gallery to only respond to clicks within its designated area, so that other page interactions remain unaffected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks outside the gallery container THEN the system SHALL NOT trigger any gallery-related events
2. WHEN a user clicks on gallery images THEN the system SHALL open the image modal as intended
3. WHEN a user interacts with navigation elements THEN the system SHALL prevent event bubbling to gallery handlers
4. WHEN the gallery is present on a page THEN the system SHALL scope its event listeners to only the gallery container

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper event handling isolation between components, so that different UI elements don't interfere with each other's functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple interactive components are present THEN the system SHALL prevent event conflicts between them
2. WHEN navigation components are rendered THEN the system SHALL have higher event priority than gallery components
3. WHEN event propagation occurs THEN the system SHALL properly stop propagation for navigation-specific events
4. WHEN components are mounted/unmounted THEN the system SHALL properly clean up event listeners to prevent memory leaks

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want consistent touch interaction behavior across all navigation elements, so that the interface feels responsive and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user performs touch gestures on navigation elements THEN the system SHALL respond only to navigation-related actions
2. WHEN a user scrolls or swipes near navigation areas THEN the system SHALL not accidentally trigger gallery interactions
3. WHEN touch events occur on overlapping elements THEN the system SHALL prioritize navigation over gallery interactions
4. WHEN the user performs rapid touch interactions THEN the system SHALL debounce events to prevent accidental triggers

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the website to maintain proper accessibility standards while fixing the click conflict, so that all users can navigate effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN screen readers are used THEN the system SHALL maintain proper focus management for navigation elements
2. WHEN keyboard navigation is used THEN the system SHALL ensure navigation elements receive focus without gallery interference
3. WHEN ARIA labels and roles are present THEN the system SHALL preserve accessibility attributes during event handling fixes
4. WHEN users navigate with assistive technologies THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback for navigation actions without gallery modal interruptions
